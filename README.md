## Unreal AI

Hey everyone! My name is Joshua Levy and I'm starting an Open Source AI project with a group of friends. There are some really interesting projects that I would like to work on as a machine learning enthusiast, and I know many people of many different talents. Believe me, this is not our day job, but I hope this serves as a medium to be expressive, intellectually stimulated, and learn some new skills along the way.

Without further-a-do, here are some initial projects that I'm interested in working on:

* Unreal Engine with Python + AI
  * Using Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks to have a car teach itself to drive.
  * Generate new organisms and have them teach themselves how to walk through GA + NN, Spore?
  * https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython
  * https://github.com/magnificus/EvolutionTree
* Generating new Music through GA + NN (Maybe LTSM) and conversion of music to and from images (deep learning)
* Visualize a book through semantic and syntactic NLP Machine Learning and image recognition
  * Images are generated as you read the book
* Recreate mental images through ML on Neuron Networks in mind, cube model perhaps..
* Simulating longitudinal social networks
  * Social Physics - Great dataset to get started with: http://realitycommons.media.mit.edu/gallery.html
  * http://d4d.orange.com/home
* Studying how anarchic organizational patterns influence social networks, and consequently the flow of ideas that can influence productivity (maybe involvement of Social Physics)
  * Concentration on idea flow (exploration and engagement) and social learning (ideas to habits, accelerated by social pressure).
* MNIST Tests with GAs and NN; high complexity models but trying to avoid overfitting
* Game of Life: Let's take inspiration from games such as spore, and civilization, and build a game which that has agents that procreate and live life. We can include omnivores, carnivores, herbivores, birds, fish, and land creatures.
* etc.

These are just some ideas. I'll add more, and we can also start a blog to document our progress and show off our knowledge and new skills.

We need people of all backgrounds to help with development. Particularly, we need:
* Data Scientists
* C++ programmers
* Python programmers
* Modelers/Designers/Artists
* Data Visualization Experts
* People who like to write about stuff
* Mostly, people with an interest looking for some fun and learning!!!

Let's explore together. Stand by for updates.

Update:

Current Projects:
* CarAI- Joshua, Hide, Daniel
* MNIST_AI- Jordan, Joshua, Jeffrey
* StoryAI- Hide, Joshua

Here's our team so far:
* Naoki - Not sure yet
* Hide - Visualization
* Joshua - Machine Learning Programmer / Data Scientist
* Jordan - Data Scientist in Training
* Jeffrey - The Idea Man / Data Scientist / Coder
* Daniel - Modeling / Artist
* Mustafa - Not sure yet
* Alex?

Lastly,
I started a blog for our development progress on Medium. Feel free to post on our page. (though here's some interesting posts about deep social networks [1](https://medium.com/@ginab/starting-a-blog-in-2017-dont-545fcefdcb2f)[2](http://try.mightynetworks.com/better_than_a_blog/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=article2&utm_campaign=betterthanblog2017)):

And if you want to check out my own personal blog:

One thing we may need to work on:
Custom anaconda environment for development. I have my own, but we will post a tutorial about how to use Anaconda to download packages. Stay tuned!!
