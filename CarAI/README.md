## Car AI

Coolest project ever. I was motivated to doing this project from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V2sX9BhAW8

Essentially, we are going to copy the project above:
1. teach a car how to drive itself by evolving neural networks (that control steering and acceleration of car) using genetic Algorithms
2. Run this evolutionary simulation after programming Unreal Engine using Python
3. Daniel will generate the models for unreal engine; essentially our environment that the car interacts with.
4. Hide will generate visualizations of the results using javascript, and we will compare self-trained cars to human input and see if machine beats humans...
5. Maybe add time constraints to additionally change the evolution of the NNs.
6. Use of C++ in this project where needed.

Short term goals:
1. Daniel and Josh meet to discuss creation of environment
2. Josh learns how to use python with unreal engine (free for students!)
3. Josh begins design of GA+NN algorithm

Background:
More details to come but I can't wait to get started!
